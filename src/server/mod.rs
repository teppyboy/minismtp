## The SMTP server

   The SMTP server is a struct that represents the server itself. It includes the following fields:
   - `config`: The configuration for the server.
   - `mail_rx`: The receiver for the mail channel.
   - `affirm_rx`: The receiver for the affirmation channel.
   - `shutdown_tx`: The sender for the shutdown channel.
   - `state`: The state of the server.

   The server can be in one of two states: `Closed` or `Listening`.

   The `Closed` state indicates that the server is not running, while the `Listening` state indicates that the server is running and listening for incoming connections.

   After creating an instance of the server, you can start it by calling the `start` method, which will spawn a task to start the server and return a `Result` indicating whether the server was started successfully.
   The returned value will be an instance of the SmtpServer struct, with a listener that can be used to receive incoming emails.

   Example:
   ```rust
    use minismtp::server::SmtpServer;
    use std::time::Duration;
    use tokio::time::timeout;

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() {
        let server = SmtpServer::new(
            "localhost",
            2525,
            "localhost",
            Some(Duration::from_secs(10)),
            None,
            None,
            None,
        );

        let listening_server = server.start().await.unwrap();

        // Actually send an email to the server and do something with this
        // returned value.
        let _ = timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), listening_server.mail_rx.recv()).await;

        listening_server.stop().await.unwrap();
    }

   ```
